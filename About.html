		<p>My interest in technology started with an AFX race track I got for Christmas. It sent my imagination whriling. My father
			at the time was studying electronics, and would patiently answer my questions about how the controllers made the cars
		go faster. I was attentive and lucky: he actually knew what he was talking about, and it laid a foundation of understanding for
		me. </p>
		<p>Fast forward a couple decades and I have two diplomas and am working on a third. People have told me I'm never satisfied and won't settle...
			and they're absolutely right! How can I when there is so much happening in our world right now?
			<em>Especially</em> in Information Technology. Fields such as Quantum Computing, Machine Learning, and the Internet,
			all of these continue to develop in exciting and astonishing ways. </p>
			<p>So where do I see myself in the next few years? Well I put together a couple of lists of some short to mid-range goals and pasted them below.
				Lets see how many of these come to fruition in the next few years. Hopefully all of them!</p>
