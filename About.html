				<p>As a student of Information Technolgy and Data Analytics I have realized the learning never 
					stops... and I like that. When I worked in automation and controls I was routinley exposed to systems and equipment that were completely new to me.
					 Figuring out how it all worked was the first step. I had google and co-workers. For sophisticated systems 
					 I was methodical and iterative. The second step was to commission the system and do compliance checks. This was 
				basically done by trying to "break" it by systematically creating every conceivable situation that could happen at runtime. I would modify and 
				adjust so that it behaved predictably. The final stage was optimization.
		Is the system uptime maximized? Is the output meeting quality control standards? Have I documented all my changes? All these steps are what I 
		consider to be the core methods and skills necessary for successfully implementing automated systems. Whatever situation I find myself in, whether it 
	is the known or the unknown, this is where I start and this is where I finish.</p>
