			<blockquote class="blockQuoteAbout">	<p>When I worked at Michelin a competition was held by the company 
			   offering prizes to whatever team had the best energy saving idea for the factory. A few departments had their ideas implemented by the company. 
			   The team I was on decided to take a more musical approach by trying to raise awareness through song. We didn't save the company any money,
			   but we had a great time doing it and were awarded a complementary basket full of goodies! </p>

			<blockquote class="blockQuoteAbout">
					<p>As part of my Professional Practices course I was given the option to do an alternative assignment. I had always been 
						curious about memory techniques and often wondered how effective thay were. Anyone who has experience with Linux knows that there
					is no easy way to remember Linux commands! So I decided to try using the Method of Loci to see if it would help me memorize 80 commands
				from Linux. What can I say except that I was blown away at the effectivness of the technique! The Method of Loci works!  </p>
